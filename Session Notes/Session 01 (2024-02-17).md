###### The Road Less Traveled

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>As the sun rises over the city of [[Baldurs Gate#Baldurs Gate|Baldur's Gate]], the members of [[LASTSTAND#LASTSTAND]] reunite at their favorite tavern, the Drunken Griffin, after a well-deserved vacation. Laughter and tales of their adventures fill the air as the group eagerly catch up on missed time.
>
>The next morning, filled with renewed vigor, LASTSTAND makes their way to Sorcerous Sundrie to replenish their supplies. Inside, they are greeted by Tinkera Drenn, a lively gnome with a twinkle in her eye. Amidst the chatter of customers browsing the shelves, Tinkera mentions a peculiar incident involving a misplaced package that needs to be delivered urgently to a cottage outside [[Waterdeep#Waterdeep]].
>
>Intrigued, the party agree to take on the task and prepare to embark on their next adventure. With their supplies restocked and a new quest at hand, LASTSTAND bids farewell to Tinkera and sets off once again, eager to unravel the mysteries that lie ahead.
>
>As the day draws to a close and the party makes camp for the night, they stumble upon a hidden clearing in the woods. Intrigued by their discovery, they decide to investigate further, uncovering a forgotten shrine dedicated to [[Tymora#Tymora]], the goddess of luck and patron deity of Kingston. Though weathered and overgrown with vines, the shrine exudes an aura of serenity, offering a moment of respite and reflection for the weary adventurers before they settle in for the night.
