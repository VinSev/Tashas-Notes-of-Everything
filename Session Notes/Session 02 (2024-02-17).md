>As the morning sun breaks through the rocky peaks, [[LASTSTAND#LASTSTAND]] ventures deeper into the rugged mountainside, their spirits lifted by the encounter with [[Tymora#Tymora|Tymora's]] sanctuary. Their journey takes them through winding paths and treacherous terrain, following the directions provided by Tinkera Drenn to locate the cottage outside [[Waterdeep#Waterdeep]].
>
>As they traverse the rugged landscape, they encounter a group of bandits lying in wait among the rocky outcrops. With weapons drawn, the party braces for combat as the bandits emerge, intent on plundering travelers along the mountain trails. The skirmish is fierce, with boulders and arrows flying amidst the echoing clash of swords. LASTSTAND fights valiantly, their skills honed through countless battles allowing them to overcome the bandits' ambush. With their foes defeated, the party takes a moment to catch their breath and tend to their wounds before pressing onward.
>
>As the sun begins to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the rugged mountainside, LASTSTAND continues their journey. Eventually, they stumble upon an ancient stone circle hidden amidst the craggy peaks. Intrigued by the mysterious structure, they decide to investigate, hoping to uncover its secrets.
>
>As they explore the area, deciphering the intricate symbols etched into the stones, LASTSTAND unlocks the circle's hidden power, feeling a surge of energy coursing through the mountain air. With the mysteries of the stone circle unveiled, the adventurers settle in for the night, their camp illuminated by the soft glow of the moon and stars overhead.
>
>Resting beneath the watchful gaze of the mountains, LASTSTAND reflects on the day's adventures, grateful for the challenges overcome and the camaraderie shared. With the promise of a new day ahead, they drift off to sleep, knowing that whatever challenges await them, they will face them together.
