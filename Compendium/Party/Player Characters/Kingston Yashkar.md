> Kingston Yashkar, the Tabaxi Paladin hailing from [[Neverwinter#Neverwinter]], embodies unwavering faith and righteous conviction within the adventuring party [[LASTSTAND#LASTSTAND]]. At least that's how he would describe himself. In reality, as a follower of [[Tymora#Tymora]], the goddess of luck, he leaves everything to chance and goes which ever way the wind blows. You've never met a more lazy, er... carefree soul.
