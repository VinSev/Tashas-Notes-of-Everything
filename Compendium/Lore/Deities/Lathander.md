>Lathander (pronounced: lah-THÆN-der) is a Faerûnian greater god with a vast portfolio including birth, renewal, spring and youth, athletics, self-perfection, vitality and creativity. The Morninglord is symbolized by the rising sun, which represents the potential of a new day. Lathander was also the central figure in the [[Dawn Cataclysm#Dawn Cataclysm]], an ill-fated attempt  to reshape the Faerûnian pantheon in his own image and the cause of "death" for [[Tyche#Tyche]], his lover at the time.
