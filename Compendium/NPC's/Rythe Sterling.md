>Rythe, a pale and bald human wizard from Waterdeep, maintains an unassuming presence in the city. Though lacking in overt magical prowess, he quietly navigates the streets, his true allegiance hidden as a member of the [[Black Fingers]]. Behind his unremarkable facade lies a secretive figure, weaving subtle threads of influence within the shadows of Waterdeep's intricate web of intrigue.
