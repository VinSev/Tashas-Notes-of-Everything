>a spirited female gnome residing in the bustling city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. By day, she's a part-time employee at [[Sorcerous Sundries]], a renowned arcane emporium where she assists customers with their magical needs. With her vibrant personality and keen intellect, she's become a familiar face among the enchanting wares of the shop. However, beneath her jovial exterior lies a secret that few are privy to: Tinkera is the caretaker of a mischievous baby red dragon, whom she affectionately calls Ignis. Despite her best efforts to keep him hidden, Ignis's playful antics occasionally threaten to reveal their clandestine companionship.
