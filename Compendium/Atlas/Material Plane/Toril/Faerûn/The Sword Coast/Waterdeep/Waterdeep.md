>Waterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors or the Crown of the North, is the most important and influential city in the North and perhaps in all of [[Faer没n#Faer没n]]. It is truly marvelous cosmopolitan city of great culture that attracts the most talented artisans, artists, and scholars from across the Realms, as well as a commercial hub for financial interests along the coast and beyond.
